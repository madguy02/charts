FILE STRUCTURE
==============

FFT.cpp
-------
	Contains functions that perform different variations Fast Fourier Transform and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform on data. It also contains a function to find the analytic signal for
	the data.


GNUPlot.cpp
-----------
	Contains functions to plot different kinds of data in different forms. It has functions to plot integer data, double data, Real part of complex data, magnitude of complex data and
	so on

Filter.cpp
----------
	Contains functions to perform various kinds of filters on the data.
	
	----Base Filter
		Base filter is a customized filter meant to random noise from the data. It filter all data with a signed value of less than -125 and replaces them with the mean of the two
		neighbouring values. It also removes all values below a NOISE_THRESHOLD(default value of 8) and sets them to zero.

	----Median Filter
		Median filter replaces all the samples in the data with the median of the 5 points in the neighbourhood.

	----Gaussian Filter
		Gaussian filter convolutes the data with 5 gaussian co-efficients to smoothen the data. The filter can be applied multiple times to smoothen the data.

	----Sgolay Filter
		Sgolay filter convolutes the data with 5 sgolay co-efficients to smoothen the data. The filter can be applied multiple times to smoothen the data.

	----Low Pass Filter
		Low pass filter is a standard rectangular low pass filter that retains frequency components upto 20% of Nyquist frequency and removes the rest of the components.


Peaks.cpp
---------
	Contains functions to find peaks in the signal envelope of the data. A separate peak detection algorithm for contact and non-contact tests are implemented.

	----Contact Peak Detection
		In contact type thickness determination, the data contains multiple reflections all from the other side of the metal. The highest peak in the data apart from the initial
		original pulse is assumed to be the first reflection pulse. A 'peak' is defined as a sample of data which is higher than all its neighbouring samples within a fixed window. 
		The second highest peak if at a equal distance from the first reflection as the first reflection is from the original pulse is considered. The number of samples between the
		second reflection peak and first reflection peak gives a measure of the time taken for the sound pulse to travel the thickness of the metal under inspection(Pulse Echo).

	----Non-contact Peak detection	
		In Non-contact type thickness determination, the data contains multiple reflections from the either surfaces of the metal. The first highest peak is the reflection from the
		front surface of the metal. The following small peaks are reflections from the back of the metal surface. This is followed by a high pulse which is the second reflection
		from the front surface of the metal. The Peaks::find_peaks_watertype(double* hil,int N) function determines the reflection from the front surface of the metal and cuts off
		the part between the first front surface reflection and second front surface reflection and passes it to Peaks::find_peaks_contacttype2(double* hil,int N) for furthur 
		analysis. This function follows a similar approach to contact peak detection to determine the multiple reflections from the back of the metal and determine the thickness
		of the metal.


technofour_config.cpp
---------------------
	Contains all the constants used in various files in the project.


technofour.cpp
--------------
Measurement Process:
	----Setup
		Opens the port for communication through FTDI interface. Also sets the various constants and settings to be used.

	----GetData
		Get a pulse of data of appropriate datalength from the Technofour after checking for the data header.

	----Filtering
		Performs basefilter, median filter and low pass filter on the data to get a smooth data without noise. This is followed by finding Hilbert Transform and the signal envelope
		of the data.

	----Peak determination
		Determines the peaks in the signal envelope.

	----Thickness determination
		Calculates the thickness based on the peaks in the signal envelope.

	----Mode calculation
		The above process is repeated for multiple pulses of data for 1 second and the modal thickness value is determined.

	----Reliability Verification
		Only if the relibility of the value is above 0.5, the thickness reading is considered to be valid and updated.

	Caliberation Mode:
		While running in caliberation mode, the velocity of the metal is calculation for metal sample of known thickness.
